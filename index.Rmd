Hi! I am a PhD candidate of Economics at the [School of Economics, Drexel University, LeBow College of Business](https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/faculty-and-research/disciplines/economics). I work at the intersection of International Trade and Industrial Organization. More specifically, I look at how firms's offshoring decisions have an impact on their R&D investment choices.
