Hi! I am a PhD candidate of Economics at the [School of Economics, Drexel University, LeBow College of Business](https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/faculty-and-research/disciplines/economics). My research lies at the intersection of International Trade and Industrial Organization. I use confidential US microdata at the Census Research Data centers to understand how firms's offshoring decisions have an impact on their R&D investment choices, patenting and employment growth.

[Here](https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/academics/doctorate/research/research-conversation-economics-phd-candidate-ishan-ghosh) I talk about my research agenda.

Prior to joining Drexel University, I gradauated from [The State University of New York (SUNY)](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/economics.html) at Buffalo with a MS in Economics (specialization: International Trade).
