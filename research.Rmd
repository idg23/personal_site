My broad research agenda lies at the intersection of International Trade and Industrial Organization. More specifically, I am particularly interested in how firms' decision to fragment production globally has an effect on their R&D choices and how that ultimately affects productivity. Exploring other innovation outcomes, I am also interested in how firms react to opposing forces of trade in the form of import competition and cheaper sourcing of intermediates by patenting and undertaking product/process innovation. I study these research questions empirically using both reduced form and theory backed structural estimation techniques. 

### Work In Progress
